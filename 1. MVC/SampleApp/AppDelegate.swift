// What is the process of starting the iOS application?
// ANSWER:
// Step 1: iOS calls Main()
// Step 2: Main creates Application Delegate
// Step 3: Once your application launches to the screen, "didFinishLaunchingWithOptions" gets triggered
// Step 4: Your app invokes the first ViewController via UIWindow object
// Step 5: You can use navigation to take users to various screens

    var window: UIWindow?

//        window = UIWindow(frame: UIApplication.)
//        window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
//        window?.rootViewController = ViewController()
